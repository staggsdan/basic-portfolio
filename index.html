            I'm Dan Staggs and I've been active in the independent music scene for over a decade. I've booked numerous tours and played shows in 25 states. Music has never been my primary income but I consider it one of my life's primary endeavors.

            Earlier in my music timeline, it was easy to be on the road and tour frequently. I was also living in a college town and it was easy to play frequently without tapping out an audience—going to shows was just something to do. As I aged into more responsibilites in life, I decided to take a more active role in booking shows and facilitating bands to meet one another and develop tour connections.

            I created a record label called What's For Breakfast? Records and began releasing LPs and 45s by great hard-working bands that exist at a scale below the attention of bigger labels. tktk Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
